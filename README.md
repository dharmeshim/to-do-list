# to-do-list
* This project is a simple command-line based to-do list application that uses object-oriented programming concepts in Python. 
* The application uses a ToDoList class, which has properties such as list name and number of tasks, and methods such as add_task, mark_task_complete, display_tasks and display_completed_tasks. 
* The application allows the user to create a new to-do list, add tasks to it, mark tasks as complete, and display all tasks and completed tasks. 
* The tasks are stored in a json file using the json module of python, this allows the user to keep the tasks even after the program is closed. 
* The program is built in such a way that it is easy to use and understand, making it a great learning tool for object-oriented programming in Python.
